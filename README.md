Goal of this project was for me to learn how to mainpulate APIs and handle responses with JSON
This project makes use of the free to use JSONPlaceholder API
It consists of an api.js file which makes a fetch request to the server. To run the file, open the terminal and run the following command: node api.js
The output should be a list of a hundred posts, each listed with its unique information such as User ID, Post ID, Post Title and Post Body.
